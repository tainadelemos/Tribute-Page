        <h2 id="tribute-info">Biography</h2>
          <ul>
           <li>
       Ada Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815 in London, England. Her father, the romantic poet Lord Byron, is said to have been unhappy with having a girl daughter.
       </li>
       <li>
       Her mother, Anne Isabella Byron, was a noble scientist and raised her daughter without the presence of Byron, who asked for the separation when the girl was 2 months old and soon moved to another country.
       </li>
       <li>
       Ada grew up under the care of her mother and maternal grandmother. From an early age Ada is encouraged by her mother to develop logical and mathematical thinking, in an effort to keep her busy and in balanced mental and psychological health.
       </li>
       <li>
       Inventive and intelligent, aged 12 Ada designs a mechanical bird capable of flapping its wings. Drawing that is published in the book Flyology (with translation for Study of flight), where he compiles his studies and ideas.
       </li>
       <li>
       Her math skills became evident at age 17. A figure of fundamental importance to Ada was the scientist Mary Sommerville, who becomes a friend and tutor.
       </li>
<h2 id="tribute-info">Innovations in Mathematics</h2>
       <li>
      Ada Lovelace meets Charles Babbage through Mary Sommerville. He was a mathematician who developed innovative studies involving an analytical machine that would become the forerunner of computers.
       </li>
       <li>
Ada is interested in Babbage's experiments and gets involved in the studies, developing codes containing numbers and symbols that would be processed by the machine.
         </li>
       <li>
She goes down in history as the first programmer, even before computers were invented.
         </li>
       <h2 id="tribute-info">Personal life and death</h2>
       <li>
At the age of 20, Ada married William Baron King in 1835, with whom she had three children: Byron, Anabella and Ralph.
         </li>
      <li>
        In 1856 Ada Lovelace died of uterine cancer, leaving at the age of 36, the same age at which her father died.
